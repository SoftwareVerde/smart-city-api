            <h3>About This Project</h3>
            <p>
                This project includes data from the city of Columbus, OH and APIs for accessing that information.
                Our goal is to make this data available and help build interest and knowledge about what is possible
                with city-level data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking to the future, we hope to see this kind of data being put to better use and encouraging both
                city officials and citizens alike to think about their city in a more data-centric way.  We hope that
                this project can not only be of use to those interested in learning more about the city of Columbus but
                also to those looking for new way to think about city planning, technology, and the future we are all
                building together.
            </p>
