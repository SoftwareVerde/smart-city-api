## Getting Started
    ./scripts/make.sh
    ./scripts/run-jar.sh
    Navigate to: http://localhost:8080

Optional:
    Configure a local MySQL instance and change the conf file: conf/server.conf and rerun ./scripts/make.sh.
    Alternatively, you may update the conf file at out/conf/server.conf, and then run ./run.sh from the "out" directory.
